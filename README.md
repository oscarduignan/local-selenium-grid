# Local Selenium Grid

Selenium Grid via selenium-server standalone

## Pros/Cons vs Docker Selenium Grid

* Good, because there is no need to setup port mappings if trying to address services in browsers via localhost (that are running on the host if using docker)
* Good, because it's likely more performant by default for more people than running browsers in docker
* Bad, because if you use chrome plugins then you can't run headless
* Bad, because the brower popping up and closing repeatedly can interrupt other work

## Usage

### Prerequisites

* bash (how I've encapsulated downloading and running the selenium server jar)
* curl (how I'm downloading the selenium server jar)
* java (how we run the selenium-server jar)
* ability to run browsers locally, you don't need any local browsers or drivers, they're all downloaded as needed by selenium (though which versions are supported are pinned in browser-versions.toml)

### Start

> [!WARNING]
> Ensure that nothing is already running on http://localhost:4444
>
> If you already have selenium grid running there, the script won't fail to start so it may look like you've successfully started it, when actually you're still interacting with the already running selenium grid service

Then, start as follows:

```
./start.sh
```

Leave it running in a terminal, and close it stop it when you're finished

Navigate to http://localhost:4444 to view the Selenium Grid dashboard

### Verify it's working

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The first time you run a test with a browser, it may be slower than the subsequent runs because selenium has to download the browser and driver binaries. You will see the browsers open and close as the tests run.

Ensure that selenium grid is started, and in a new terminal:

1. `git clone https://github.com/hmrc/platform-test-example-ui-journey-tests.git`
2. `cd platform-test-example-ui-journey-tests`
3. [Follow the instructions for starting required services](https://github.com/hmrc/platform-test-example-ui-journey-tests?tab=readme-ov-file#services)
3. `./run-tests.sh chrome`
4. `./run-tests.sh edge`
5. `./run-tests.sh firefox`
